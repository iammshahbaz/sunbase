# Visual Form Designer

## Project Overview

The **Visual Form Designer** is a web application that allows users to visually design forms by adding, reordering, editing, and deleting form elements such as input fields, select dropdowns, and text areas. It uses drag-and-drop functionality to let users organize form elements dynamically and save the configuration.

## Features

- **Add New Form Elements:** Users can add an unlimited number of input fields, select dropdowns, and text areas to the form.
- **Edit Form Elements:** Users can modify labels, placeholders for input fields and text areas, and options for select dropdowns.
- **Reorder Form Elements:** The form elements can be reordered via drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Delete Form Elements:** Users can delete individual form elements from the form.
- **Save Form Configuration:** After modifying the form, users can save the updated form structure. The JSON structure of the form is logged in the console.
- **Toast Notifications:** Users receive success messages when form elements are added or deleted.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts based on screen size, providing a mobile-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the page content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the form designer and implementing responsive design.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For handling form interactions, drag-and-drop, and state management.

## Usage Instructions

    - Select elements can have their options modified directly.

3. **Reorder Elements:**
    - Click and drag elements to reorder them in the form.

4. **Delete Elements:**
    - Each form element has a delete button in the top-right corner. Clicking it will remove the element from the form.
